Stash

It's possible to go immediately to mkvm and launch a server (see
mkvm(1)) but in most cases after installing stash (make
PREFIX=/path/to/stash install) some things should be configured first.

Create private (eg. organisation) repository ~/repo

  $ mkdir ~/repo
  $ echo domain=example.com > ~/repo/org.sh # 99% required
  $ cd ~/repo && git init # git maintenance hereby assumed

Create environment

  $ mkenv [~/repo/]env.dev # Creates a signing key in ~/.stash/repo-dev-*

    Sources ~/repo/org.sh; signify on OpenBSD, probably gpg on linux.

Configure site/repository & environment (eg. hvm, os, ssh)

  $ cp ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub ~/repo/role.keys/pub.ssh.ca # etc.
  $ vi ~/repo/org.sh
  $ vi ~/repo/env.dev/env.sh
  ... set variables such as os_*, hvm* (already are env domain stash_(pub)key)
  ... Documented at the top of libstash.sh for now; beware namespaces

Create roles

  $ mkdir ~/repo/role.mything
  $ vi ~/repo/role.mything/role.sh
  ... define role_settings, role_apply; rolevar in either, role_method/_filetype in _settings
  ... (TODO-ish) role depends in _settings

Launch server

  $ mkvm -I ~/Downlad/Installer.iso -n foo -r mything [-i 0] ~/repo ...

    Performs the following two steps by running role_apply in
    /root/stash/role.mything/role.sh after doing each dependency first

    Might ask for signing password.

    Might require local root (depends on local and target operating
    systems; usually only to loopback-mount).

Alternatively:

Create disc image

  $ mkclone -I ~/Download/Installer.iso [~/repo ...] # incl. options for disc size etc.

    Creates an auto-install out of a downloaded ISO & boots a VM to
    run it once, at this point it can be snapshotted, copied, uploaded
    to AWS as an AMI, etc. Can be easily adapted to chroots, jails,
    dockers or whetever the nom du jour is today.

    Includes options for stash-source, platform, disc size, proxies, etc.

    Might require local root.

Then create an instance by booting it with a stash archive (ie. a
collection of roles and an environment definition)

  $ mkinstance -f usb -s signify -n foo -r mything [-i 0] ~/repo ...

    Includes options for stash-source, memory, naming, maybe extra discs?

    Might ask for signing password.
