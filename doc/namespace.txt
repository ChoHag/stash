To be expanded on in here, for now the rules from initial-setup.txt:

  Stash is a bourne shell application; see sh(1). Variables are not
  exported to the environment by default (except for stash, maybe).

  Roles are stored in a directory named 'role.' followed by the role's
  name. The name must consist only of lower case ascii: letters,
  numbers, the hyphen or underscore; it can begin only with a letter.

  Each role owns the namespace of shell variables beginning with its
  name (with hyphens converted to underscore).

    For the benefit of doubt a subsequent underscore is _not_ required
    and there is a conflict between roles named with a hypen and those
    named with an underscore. Deal with it.

  Environments follow the same rules with the directory named
  'env.*'. They don't have their own namespace because that makes no
  sense except in one specific place where for now I'm taking
  ${environment}__*.

  All variables beginning with underscore are private to stash. Those
  not claimed as reserved words are private to the role of that name.

  Variables in all caps (except APP) are ignored by stash.
