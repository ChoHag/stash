format
os installs
create users
install software
configure backup

A word of warning: Stash creates CDs which will DESTROY YOUR COMPUTER,
replacing it with itself. Do not leave CDs or ISO files lying around
or you will almost certainly ruin someone's day and that person will
almost certainly be you. All default filenames chosen by stash will
include the text 'auto-reformat'.

Although formatting and OS extraction (including writing the boot
sector) can be done directly from another system, stash instead
manipulates an installer ISO to run noninteractively. The main reason
for this is so that the same process can be used to create virtual
machines and real servers and that their initial configuration happens
in an environment identical to that which an administrator would
operate manually.

Also we have VMs now so it's easy.

In order to create an ISO file which can boot to a fully working,
active server we need to break down the manual steps and reorder them
a little. For one, everything needs to be performed before 'boot'.

First a little aside to define done.

The end result is a running server, virtual or otherwise. In the
middle there will be an ISO which turns an empty hard drive (or set of
same) into a working network server which can then be made live
(ie. plugged into a machine/hvm and turned on). This means a few
things need to come preconfigured.

In addition configuring the server when the installer has finished is
going to involve running some other script or tool and that's going to
expect a particular environment.

To summarise then:

Stash will create an ISO file which when booted will format one or
more hard drives and install and then configure a variant of unix or
linux on them:

  ( Items marked with a hyphen (-) can be set with )
  ( command-line arguments or configuration files. )

- * Default hostname will be changemehost.changemedomain
 -* Default network configuration will be single ipv4 dhcp with ipv6 disabled (only -6)
  * root will not have a password but ssh will be configured to permit root login
- * An optional script will execute the first time the server is booted
- * Optionally a ssh certificate can be installed in /etc/ssh/ssh_host_*_cert
- * Optionally a ssh key can be installed in /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
  * The console will be directed to the first serial port at 115200 bps (8n)
  * No extra users will be configured
  * The timezone will be set to UTC
  * Where possible the locale will be, in descending order of preference,
    C, en, en_GB, en_US. In all cases .UTF-8 is tried first
- * Optionally a http proxy address can be configured (differently in phases)
- * Where possible a default or optional package repository will be configured
- * A (mostly) stripped down set of software will be installed. This will include:
    (I can't believe I have to list some of these explicitly but they weren't somewhere)
    # standard posixish & shell utilities (ie. most of /*bin and some of /usr/*bin)
    # bc
    # ed
    # ifconfig
    # iotop
    # less
    # logrotate
    # man
    # netcat (openbsd where available)
    # tcpdump
    # telnet
    # tmux
    # vi
  * nano will be removed

Now on to the steps. To begin I'll describe each step and the problems
which arise from automating it.

= get installer cd =

Buy or download. Downloaded files should be cryptographically
verified. This step is mostly out of the purview of stash so it's a
good opportunity to mention that encryption and verification play a
major part in stash so you should create an SSH keypair to use as a
certificate authority (although one is not required to make an
installer iso). You'll also need a code repository to keep that and
other public keys or certificates along with server configuration
code, so create one.

= get computer =

Although stash can't get you a computer or even use one, it can start
and stop VMs and can be configured with a hypervisor to manage the
final stages of turning the ISO into a running server.

Taking advantage of this stash has broken up the steps such that an
image file can be created after the OS is installed (which takes a
long time) and later cloned into new VMs (which doesn't) which are
each given a (signed) package of instructions to complete the process
(which packages can grow quite large).

= boot cd =

As mentioned, this has to come last. It's not so hard to automate but
ISOs or images (or scripts) may need to be transferred over the
network at various points, which requires bandwidth and authorisation.

= answer questions =

So far every platform I've seen has somewhere the ability to inject a
file answering the questions the installer would otherwise
ask. Naturally in OpenBSD this is called the answers file but other
platforms have their own names such as preseed or kickstart.

Unfortunately getting the file to the installer is not so easy. Most
platforms expect that if you're booting from a CD you'll provide the
answers file some other way such as a URL at the boot prompt. It turns
out CDs are made of really cheap plastic and easy to write to but the
operating system vendors never really caught on.

This file is hand-crafted for each platform and comes with stash,
usually in /usr/local/share/stash/answers. It will usually need to
have changes made to it to satisfy the needs of the other steps (and
the optional extras) so should be easy to manipulate from code
(usually shell).

= format =

Bloody hell. This now. So each platform has its own way of doing this,
its own way of automating it and its own set of gotchas if you try and
work around their braindeadedness. OpenBSD's is the best, if it can be
called that, because it's not there at all and if you want to do
anything more than simple partitioning then you drop out to the shell
and just do it.

Unfortunately even _that_ isn't always enough because although you can
easily format the discs, you still need to inform the installer about
them in many cases. Actually being formated, mounted and ready is not
enough and often breaks.

I've adopted the OpenBSD disklabel template format such that I think
it can cover most peoples' needs. In particular it supports staying
out of the way if you just want plain partitions/slices, software
RAID, LVM & ZFS.

Whether they can be made to work depends mostly on how restricted the
installer's pre-install environment is. And availability of course.

I have had success creating an installer which uses debootstrap in a
live environment but while I am planning to include that as an option
I would prefer that be an alternative to the main ISO-creation method.

= os installs =

Sit back and wait. A long time.

= create users =
= install software =
= configure backup =

Performing these steps is easy and there are more tools to do it than
you can count. Ansible and Salt seem to be en vogue at the
moment. Stash includes its own but it's by no means necessary.

Ultimately the problem comes down to these three though. The previous
steps were traditionally all performed manually because, well, they're
all manual steps. Even in an automated environment they still need to
be performed by hand:

  get installer cd: Who's? Why? How do we trust it?
  get computer    : From where? Why? Who's paying and how many?
  boot cd         : Someone chooses when a server is activated (or which
                    software to run which chooses).
  answer questions: Most of the questions asked by the installer depend
                    on some human-directed policy.
  format          : The needs and availability of the server determine how
                    to format it; a human chooses both of those things and
                    decides on the layout.
  os installs     : You don't need a human to run the tar -x but you need
                    someone drink tea and watch it.

So why is it a problem for automation? It's comes down to three things:

 * How do we get the software package onto the server?
 * How do we verify it?
 * How do we obtain further secrets (keys) we may need (or: how does
   this server identify and authenticate itself)?

There are 2 different ways to run stash. Either create an ISO which
creates a single unique server, or create an ISO which can be later
combined with a package, either immediately or by cloning the hard
drive it generated prior to the first boot, to uniquely identify a
server. The package can be delivered in many ways. I will refer to
this package as Userdata because I figure I might as well use amazon
for something.

When the OS is initially installed, apart from creating the
standardised environment described above stash also embeds a public
key which can verify the userdata from any source such as
http, which location is recorded for use after the first boot, and in
the case of the ISO being specialised for an individual server, embeds
the userdata directly (which effectively pre-verifies it) and
the server's unique identity.

Verifying the new server's identity, from which authentication
credentials can come, is made possible either by embedding a secret
and certificate in the userdata or obtaining a public key from
/etc/ssh over a trusted medium such as the serial console, which is
then signed.

mkautoiso
mkenv - create signing key & config
mkstash - build userdata
mkvm - start a vm on a hypervisor using [1].
mkclone - prepare an image to be cloned or booted for [2,2½]
mkinstance - start a vm on a hypervisor using [2,2½]

Future maybe:
mkupdateiso - create an iso which, when booted, will mount the os and
run upgrade, for people about to clone many machines which could be a
month or two behind; alternative to simply building a new image then
and there to clone.


stash/run:
# Expectations:
# Must be run as root
# Takes over the environment's lower-case keys
# Creates /etc/stash
# Supplemental stash requires a validation key in validator=/etc/ssh/ssh_ca_cert
# Arguments [role[/environment=dev] [fqdn]]
